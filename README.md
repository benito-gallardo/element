# Element Pages

## the source code for [https://volusion.github.io/element](https://volusion.github.io/element)

### Developing

- Run `npm run develop` in the terminal to start the dev site.
- Run `npm run build` to generate the static files in the `public/` directory.
- Run `npm run serve` to view the built files. _cannot be running `npm run develop` at the same time_

### Deploying

Run `npm run deploy`. This builds the files and pushes them to the `gh-pages` branch for automagical deployment.

_based on the starter from [here](https://github.com/codebushi/gatsby-starter-dimension)_
